County\nEqualization serves as a check on assessments determined at the local level, ensuring they are fair\nand equitable across the County.\nThe responsibilities of County Equalization rest primarily with each County’s Board of\nCommissioners. Recognizing the technical and difficult nature of equalization duties, the State,\nthrough the General Property Tax Act, requires each County to employ a certified Equalization\nDirector to assist and advise the Board in fulfilling their duties.\nIn addition to the general purpose of ensuring fair and equitable assessments, statutory\nrequirements of County Equalization include the collection and analysis of sales data, providing\nassessment assistance to local units, and providing the State Tax Commission with annual reports.\nThe purpose of this document is to provide County officials with information regarding the\nstatutory and State Tax Commission guidelines for County Equalization. The policies can be\nfound in the General Property Tax Act of 1893, as amended and State Tax Commission rules and\npublications.\nBASIC REQUIREMENTS\nEach County must establish a Department of Equalization and appoint a Director of that\ndepartment.
