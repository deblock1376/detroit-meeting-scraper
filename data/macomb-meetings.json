Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms herein\nhave the same meaning as in the Order Form. Placer and Customer agree to amend the Order Form as\nfollows:\n1. The Term of the Order Form will be renewed for 12 months starting January 1, 2026 (“Renewal\nDate”).\n2. Starting on the Renewal Date, the Annual License Fee will increase from $42,142 to $45,513.\n3.

As we work\nthrough the final year of the current contract, additional programs of high-complexity will be deployed adding to the\nmore than $1M in current estimated ROI. As we consider the forthcoming license renewal, we want to ensure that the\nCounty is provided the most powerful technology available, with few-to-no prohibitive and corporate-imposed\nparameters, at little-to-no additional cost. Moreover, we want to ensure that Macomb County is insulated from any price\nincreases during this period. Our proposal achieves all of these things.\nKey Changes:\n● License to be upgraded and expanded to our full Customer Experience Management Suite - This will vastly enhance the\navailable technological capabilities of the toolset by incorporating purpose built features supporting digital applications,\nlocation based applications, enhanced integration options, and more.\n● Digital Experience Analytics included - This tool passively captures important web session data to assess UX on all\nMacomb County Domains. Through our digital feedback project on macombgov.org we have captured feedback from\nroughly 1,000 residents on the status of the new website, and this feedback has identified numerous opportunities for\nimprovement. In fact, 69% of respondents were unable to find what they were looking for on the website and 76% were\nunable to complete the purpose of their visit. Our DXA tool will rapidly identify broken web experiences without needing\nto ask anybody what is not working.\n● Unlimited Users - This proposal would remove all user caps on the Macomb County license. Currently, Macomb County is\napproaching their total user counts (350 across the two brands) and this would allow them to support as many\nin-platform users as they see fit - inclusive of local community partners they support via funding and programming.\n● License Consolidation - The two brands will be moved under the same license. We will keep the operations and data\nseparate between the brands to continue to ensure PHI data is protected and within HIPAA compliance, but as back end\ncapabilities continue to develop it will become increasingly easier to access data between brands where appropriate, as\ndetermined by the County.\n● AI Capabilities included - All of our new AI capabilities for the CX Suite will be available in this new license.
